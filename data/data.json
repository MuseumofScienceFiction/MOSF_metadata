    "Long_Description": "The Djinn chair is a piece of furniture in the Modernist style, created by French designer Olivier Mourgue in 1964. Originally called the \"Low fireside chair,\" it is also commonly referred to as the \"2001 chair,\" because of its prominent appearance in the film, 2001: A Space Odyssey.\n\nThe Djinn chair and a chaise lounge, was introduced by Airborne in Merignac Cedex, France. The rest of the series was released in 1965, and includes the iconic \"Low fireside chair,\" a two-seat sofa, and a foot stool. The set remained in production until 1976.\n\nThe name \"Djinn\" refers to an Islamic spirit capable of changing shape. The design's low profile was an attempt to emulate the informal lifestyle of the time. The set was introduced during a time when growing interest in Eastern mysticism was influencing Western decorative arts. \n- from Wikipedia",

    "Long_Description": "This piece reflects the myriad of emotions which were stirred up in all of us in the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic as we notice the biohazard symbol that is on the wall. Heavy fog is spread across the scene, obscuring the view of a lone figure in a hazmat suit and encouraging speculation on this person’s thoughts as they stand alone. Do they feel fear? Is their stance one of loneliness or courage, boredom or hope? \nThe mist’s distinct yellow color is ominous, and may represent mustard gas, the first lethal chemical gas used on a large scale on the battlefields during WWI. Here, it is used masterfully to represent a significant and unknowable danger.",

Coming at a time when our world and our reality seems to be in a free fall, Kilmczak weaves complex sculptural renderings into a wide natural landscape. This thought-provoking depiction of a young girl confronting a tank portrays the dissonance between inner and outer space, ultimately exploring how the intangible spaces within us — such as memory, knowledge, and the perception of time — are regimented.",

In the center of the piece there is a solitary alien structure, somehow floating above the earth.

The overall tone is up for interpretation, filled with both trepidation and hopefulness at the prospect of coming into contact with an unknown future.",

    "Location": "Special Exhibit Area 2",

    "Long_Description": "This stunning piece portrays an astronaut in the midst of a vast desert landscape, surrounded by the ruins of an ancient civilization. The astronaut is clad in a space suit and helmet, with equipment that suggests he is conducting scientific research. The ruins are rendered in intricate detail, with weathered columns rising up from the sand. The sky overhead is filled with dust, with heavy fog that suggests a sense of stillness and isolation.\n\nToo Far From Home is a fascinating meditation on the relationship between the past and the future, and the human desire for knowledge and understanding. The juxtaposition of the astronaut's modern technology with the ancient ruins serves to underscore the idea that exploration and discovery are timeless human endeavors, spanning across cultures and civilizations.\n\nThis work also invites us to consider the relationship between humanity and the natural world. The desert landscape is rendered in vivid detail, with the patterns in the sand and the patterns on the ruins carefully observed. The ruins themselves are a reminder of the impermanence of human achievement, as even the most impressive civilizations eventually fall into ruin and decay.",

The man appears to be a survivor of some catastrophic event that has left the world in ruins. The shelter, his “Home Sweet Home”, serves as the man's only refuge in this barren wasteland, although it is rusted and abandoned.\n\nKlimczak has skillfully captured the sense of isolation and despair that this survivor must be feeling. His posture suggests a sense of weariness and resignation. The muted colors and hazy atmosphere convey a world stripped of its vitality, where human civilization has begun to fall into ruins.\n\nDespite the bleakness of the scene, there is a glimmer of hope in the figure's presence. The fact that he is still standing, still creating a home for himself, suggests a resilience and determination that may yet lead to a brighter future.",

The image of an old man standing alone on a desolate beach, watching a technological marvel emerge from the depths of the sea, suggests a sense of awe and wonder at the marvels of human achievement. At the same time, it also evokes a sense of melancholy and nostalgia, as we reflect on the passing of an era and the changing of the guard.\n\nThe painting also invites us to contemplate the relationship between humanity and the natural world. The contrast between the steel of the submarine and the organic forms of the ocean and the beach highlights the tensions between the modern world and the natural world, and suggests that the two are not always in harmony.",

The juxtaposition of the astronaut's space suit against the natural surroundings creates a sense of adventure, reminding us of humanity's capacity to both partake in and observe the natural world.\n\nAt the same time, the image of an astronaut standing in a field also symbolizes the unifying spirit of human exploration, as we continue to push the boundaries of what is possible, and to seek knowledge and understanding beyond our immediate surroundings. It is entirely possible that the connection to nature that we can already sense on Earth may also be felt on other planets, or in entirely new galaxies.",

The spaceship's departure represents a new beginning, a chance for humanity to start afresh and rebuild its future among the stars. Last Ship Departed is a poignant reminder of the human spirit's resilience and ability to adapt to even the most challenging of circumstances.",
